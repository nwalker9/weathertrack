## Project Description
This project builds an automated data pipeline that collects daily weather data from a public API and stores it for future analysis. The pipeline retrieves weather data for multiple cities and saves it into a structured CSV file.

The real-world purpose of this project is to simulate how organizations track and store weather data over time for planning, forecasting, and analytics.

## API Used
Open-Meteo Weather API  
https://open-meteo.com/en/docs 

### Why this API?
We chose the Open-Meteo API because:
- It is free and requires no authentication  
- It provides structured JSON data  
- It allows multiple location queries

### Constraints
- No authentication required  
- Rate limits are minimal but still respected  
- Data is returned in JSON format  
- Requires multiple API calls for different cities  

## Data Pipeline Goals
- Fetch daily weather data for multiple cities (Tallahassee, Miami, Atlanta)  
- Extract key weather metrics (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, etc.)  
- Store results in a CSV file for long-term tracking  
- Append new data on each run instead of overwriting  
- Handle API errors gracefully without crashing

2. python3 src/pipeline.py

## Example Run
Command:
```bash
python3 src/pipeline.py
```

Example Output:
```
Tallahassee: 200
Miami: 200
Atlanta: 200
Appended 21 rows to data/processed/weather_data.csv
```
